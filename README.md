## BFS and DFS searching algorithoms
It's a personal challenge, just for practice.
The code contains a visual part in App.java just for visual results, but the agent algorithm is in Agent.java. The file Map.java contains the map information; you can change it and add as many rows and columns as you want.

<h2>Some map information</h2>
    *1 -> Wall
    *0 -> Wallcable Path
    *9 -> Spawn or Start Position
    *5 -> Goal
    *6 -> Cell Visited by the Agent
    *7 -> Cell Opened
    *3 -> Agent Path to the Goal

Also you can change the collors if you want.
